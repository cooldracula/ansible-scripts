# Planetary Server Hardening Role

This role is intended to be one of the first run when creating a new server, to do some basic security hardening.

The primary goals of this role are to:
- ensure software is up to date
- restrict logins and avoid easy brute-forcing into the server
- add firewalls to only broadcast from intentional ports

## Ensuring software is up to date
We set a dependency in this role for our common role, which mainly does a software update and installs some of our necessary programs.

## Restricting logins
This role sets that you must login with an ssh key, removing the ability to just use a username and password.

In addition, it creates an admin user and removes the ability to login as root. The admin user is part of the sudo group, and so can perform higher-clearance tasks if needed, but from this point forward nothing should be done directly as root.

**Note: after running this role, you will not be able to login as root. You will login as `{{admin_username}}@server_address`**

## Add Firewalls

We use [UFW](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW), the default firewall configuration for ubuntu and set it as highly restricted by default. After this role runs, the only port enabled is the ssh port.

The roles you run after this, if they are setting up an externally accessible service, should include a UFW task that enables the required ports.
