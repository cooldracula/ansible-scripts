# Deletes the feed of the given user id on all Planetary pubs. This is very innefficient
# as it rewrites the entire db. It also will cause the pub to be unresponsive for ~15
# minutes after the playbook ends while the flume views are rebuilt.
#
# Note: this does not publish a block message for the feed, so it could be resynced. 
# To block a user see the block-user.yml playbook.
#
# Usage: ansible-playbook delete-feed.yml -i {inventory} --extra-vars "id='{feedID}'"
